# Open-source Technologies & Stream Mining Joint Project

This repository is for the joint project of subjects **Open-source Technologies** and **Stream Mining** of the *Data Science MSc program* at *ELTE*.

Project guidelines: [Open guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fuBle3d4tmhY9IHqBDA9KwckhSqOCugGWldIe8CeRHc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.mzrt1sfgv63y)

## About the project

In this project, sensor data related to air quality is simulated, streamlined, processed, modeled, stored, and visualized to develop a full-stack *stream mining* data science project powered by *open-source technologies*.

The sensor data includes readings of pollutants such as *Carbon Monoxide (CO)*, *Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)*, along with measurements of *Temperature*, and *Absolute* / *Relative Humidity*.

Objectives are to detect abnormal changes in the sensor readings and to create short-term forecasts to support planning and public health responses in the simulation.
